## SEO Improvement Tasks

1. Add canonical tags for `https://dao-watch-website.vercel.app/` to avoid duplicate indexing issues.
2. Define meta keywords relevant to DAO governance resources, episodes, and videos to aid contextual search cues.
3. Provide explicit `robots` meta directives (e.g., `index,follow`) on key templates to ensure intended crawl behavior.
4. Configure server headers or meta tags for `X-Robots-Tag` to keep future media or docs crawlable (or disallow, as needed).
5. Publish a `robots.txt` file that allows the main site while disallowing sensitive routes; include sitemap reference.
6. Generate and host a `sitemap.xml` covering resources, episodes, and video pages for better discovery in search consoles.
7. Review page structure to add more descriptive headings (increase H2/H3 coverage) for rich keyword distribution.
8. Optimize body copy to exceed 200 words on the homepage with naturally placed DAO governance keywords.
9. Audit internal links (currently 21) to ensure descriptive anchor text and prioritize high-value destinations.
10. Compress and add descriptive `alt` text to the 3 images to improve accessibility and image search ranking.
